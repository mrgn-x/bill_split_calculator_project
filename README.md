Creating a calculator to split bills between any number of people.
You will be prompted to enter in the total bill amount. Only enter in numbers. No other symbols necessary.
You will then be prompted to enter in the tip amount selected. Only enter in numbers. No other symbols necessary.
You will then be prompted to enter in the number of people the bill is being split between. Only enter in numbers. No other symbols necessary.
You will then receive the total amount including the tip and then how much each person pays for their share.
This only does equal shares of the bill, not percentage amounts of the bill.
The numbers are rounded to two decimal places. In regards to this, the total amount due by each person may not add up exactly to the total amount.
Please use discretion when viewing the total.
